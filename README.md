MAST - Multicast Audio Streaming Toolkit
========================================
Nicholas J. Humfrey


What is MAST ?
--------------

MAST is an audio streaming broadcaster and client using RTP over
IPv4 and IPv6 Multicast/Unicast.

Unlike VAT and RAT, which are designed primerily for audio conferencing, MAST
is designed to be used for audio distribution and broadcast. It is currently limited 
to recieving a single audio source, unlike RAT which can mix serveral sources.

It supports many of the audio payload types in the Audio-visual Profile (RTP/AVP).

MAST is licenced under the GNU General Public License, see the file COPYING for details.

Current Limitations
-------------------

- No mixer support (can only recieve single source).
- No sample rate conversion support.
- No upmixing/downmixing support.
- No clock skew error correction.
- mast_rawcast currently only supports GSM and MPEG Audio.
- due to problems with oRTP, only 8000Hz streams can be recieved.
